# Pod and Resource Naming Conventions

This section explains Grove's hierarchical naming scheme for pods and resources. Grove's naming convention is designed to be **self-documenting**: when you run `kubectl get pods`, the pod names immediately tell you which PodCliqueSet, PodCliqueScalingGroup (if applicable), and PodClique each pod belongs to.
